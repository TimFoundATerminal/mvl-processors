# Ternary Emulation POC

Technology and research always goes through a period of divergence as people push their knowledge and understanding. These ideas then later begin to converge back on a single idea that becomes the defacto standard. Much like phone charging ports and the standard plug.

However this is not always the best idea. The combustion engine was the dominant choice within the automotive industry but years later we are going back to electric vehicles.

Ternary logic was one of these ideas that was developed and then later left dormant in the past with no clear indication as to why apart from the rise of binary computers.

# Idea Bank

- Using two memory banks to represent the third possible value in ternary logic. Means that only the memory manager would have to change between the circuits. The other idea is to use an integer array to make the comparison between binary and trinary logic more comparable for the cost of raw performance of the emulator.
- MIPS architecture has an emulator built on top of it called SPIM but looks very complex and will be difficult to rebuild the logic in ternary.

# Form Submission

Hi, I am Thomas Timmons, a 3rd year undergrad with a year long placement which I completed at Mercedes Formula One Team. While the majority of my experience is with higher level languages and tools, I have a strong mathematical foundation which can be seem in my grades for the following modules.

- Principles of Programming - 92%
- Data Structures and Algorithms - 93%
- Functional Programming - 85%
- Foundations of Computation - 85%
- Machine Learning - 85%

I have always been interested in ternary logic as I came up with the idea independently while in high school in computer science. However a quick search revealed it had been studied extensively but appeared to have computational advantages over binary systems. It has had my had my attention since then so when thinking about potential projects for a dissertation I thought it would be a great opportunity to investigate the field.
