\section{Introduction}

Binary Logic has been the defacto standard for digital systems since the inception of the transistor. However, due to the 
imminent end of Moore's Law, researchers have been looking for alternative methods to increase the performance of digital
systems. This paper will attempt to realise the theoretical performance gains of ternary logic within an emulator. We can 
then measure and project the performance on the assumption it should be possible to implement these circuits as hardware.

aim to build the foundation on which the project will be based.\\

\subsection{Ternary Algebra}

The cost or complexity of number systems can be evaluated through representation efficiency,
computational overhead, and implementation requirements.\\
\\
Representation efficiency refers to how digits or symbol are required represent any given range of values $N$, with the base of the number system represented 
by $R$ and the necessary number of digits required is $d$ (rounded upwards to the nearest integer):

\begin{equation}
  N = R^{d}
\end{equation}

This directly impacts the memory usage and storage costs in a computing system.\\
\\
The computational overhead involves the complexity of performing basic arithmetic operations. Larger bases require the managing of more states, requiring the 
processing of a larger set of possible combinations. The number of possible combinations is given by:

\begin{equation}
  C = R^{i}
\end{equation}

Where $i$ is the number of inputs for the operation and $R$ is the base of the number system as defined before. For example, the number of possible combinations 
for addition is $C = R^{2}$ which in binary is $C = 2^{2} = 4$ creating the set $\{0+0, 0+1, 1+0, 1+1\}$. 
In ternary the set would be $C = 3^{2} = \{0+0, 0+1, 0+2, 1+0, 1+1, 1+2, 2+0, 2+1, 2+2\} = 9$ which requires implementing more logic circuits to handle the 
additional combinations.\\
\\
Implementation requirements consider the the practical aspects of building a system that works with a given base. This includes 
error detection and correction using approaches such as Hamming Code's in binary logic % \citep{hamming1950error}.
As this paper aims to explore the performance of ternary logic systems in comparison to binary systems within an emulator, we will not be considering 
the practical challenges of implementing ternary logic in hardware.\\
\\

TODO: understand how this logic below impacts the performance of the ternary logic system.

The cost or complexity of the system $C$ is directly proportional to the capacity of the digits $(R \cdot d)$.
Therefore for some constants $k$ and $\log N$
% \citep{hurst1984mvl}:

\begin{equation}
  C = k(R \cdot d) = k \left( R \cdot \frac{\log N}{\log R} \right) = k \log N \left(\frac{R}{\log R}\right)
\end{equation}

Minimising this cost $C$ can be done by differentiating with respect to $R$ and setting the result to $0$:

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial C}{\partial R} = 
  k\log N\cdot\frac{d}{dR}\left[\frac{R}{\log R}\right] = 
  k\log N\cdot \frac{\log R -1}{(\log R)^2} = 0
\end{equation}

After removing constants $\log R = 1$ and solving for $R = e = 2.718$. Since as stated above, the radix $R$ must be an 
integer then we are left with $R = 3$. Therefore, the ternary logic system is the most efficient.\\
% \citep{jaber2020mvl}.
\\
In binary logic set of possible values is denoted as $\mathbb{B} = \{0, 1\}$. Ternary numeral systems can either unbalanced 
ternary values $\mathbb{T} = \{0, 1, 2\}$ or balanced ternary values $\mathbb{T} = \{-1, 0, 1\}$ with 
a variety of glyphs used to represent the values where $\overline{1}$ or $T$ is sometimes used to represent $-1$.\\
\\
Balanced ternary has the elegant property that of representing negative numbers intrinsically without the need for a 
separate signed bit. This leads to more symmetric carry rules due to a more even distribution around zero as shown in 
Figure \ref{fig:ternary_ops}.\\

    \caption{Balanced Ternary Single-Trit Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division Tables}
    \label{fig:ternary_ops}
\end{figure}
For subtraction and division which are not commutative, the first operand is given to the left of the table and the second at the top.\\
\\
Balanced ternary has a range of advantages when it comes to computation over binary logic such as the reduction in the carry rate for 
addition/subtraction cuts down the carry rate in multi-digit multiplication as demonstrated in Figure \ref{fig:ternary_ops} with 
the values being $2/9$ and $1/4$ respectively. Also notice that it is possible to perform subtraction by negating the second operand and 
adding the two values together which will useful for the implementation of the ternary logic gates.\\
\\
Therefore, for this paper and emulator we will be using balanced ternary logic and any mention of `ternary logic` is referring to 
`balanced ternary logic`.\\
\\
To calculate the value of a ternary number $T$ with a radix point in decimal we can use the following formula:\\
TODO: this is not right and needs to be fixed.\\
\begin{equation}
    v = (a_{n}a_{n-1} \dotsb a_{0}.c_{1}c_{2}c_{3} \dotsb)_3 = \sum_{i=0}^{n} a_{i} 3^{i} + \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} c_{i} 3^{-i}
\end{equation}
Where $n$ and $m$ are the number of digits to the left and right of the radix point respectively and $v$ is the value in decimal given 
a vector of values containing a radix point.\\

To directly compare between the binary and ternary systems we need to consider how we can encode binary values into ternary values and 
vice versa. Using continued fractions, the best approximations to rationals are given by convergents to the continued fraction, 
alternating between overshooting and undershooting the target value.\\
\\
Since we are looking for $2^{a} \approx 3^{b}$ where $a,b \in \mathbb{N}$. Taking the logarithm of both sides we get:
\begin{equation}
    \frac{a}{b} \approx \frac{\log 3}{\log 2}
\end{equation}
Where $2^{a} < 3^{b}$ to ensure that the binary value can be encoded into a ternary value.\\

Gates can be represented in matrix form where the following Binary AND truth table has the has the equivalent matrix representation:\\

\subsubsection{Single-Input Gates}

Single-input gates can be represented as a vector of length $2$ for binary logic and length $3$ for ternary logic. Combination theory 
shows that the number of possible combinations for a single input gate is $n^{n}$ where $n$ is the number of inputs. Therefore, the 
number of possible combinations for a single input gate is $2^{2} = 4$ and $3^3 = 9$ for binary and ternary logic gates. Most of these 
are redundant so only the useful gates have been listed in Figure \ref{fig:single_value_gates}.\\

All of the gates in Figure \ref{fig:two_value_bin_gates} and \ref{fig:two_value_ter_gates} have inverted equivalents that can be
created by negating the output will be denoted with an N proceeding the gate name. e.g. NAND, NOR, NANY.\\

\subsubsection{Assumptions}

Researchers have attempted to investigate this field using two distinct approaches. One from a more theoretical perspective
or looking at the theoretical gains of ternary logic while others taking a more practical approach. Ternary test benches
have been created in order to attempt to validate the theoretical performance gains.

However, the underlying implementations of the basic ternary logic is underpinned by Complementary Metal Oxide 
Semiconductor (CMOS) along with it's PMOS and MNOS. Thus the fundamental reliance on the binary nature of the underlying 
hardware limits the performance gains that can be achieved.
For this project we will assume that comparable binary and ternary logic gates have the same propagation delay. This will allow us to
to directly compare the performance of the two systems. Implications of this assumption will be discussed in the conclusion.\\

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
  AND &\equiv \mathbb{T}AND \\
  OR &\equiv \mathbb{T}OR \\
  NOT &\equiv \mathbb{T}NOT
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

This will allow us to create a basic binary and ternary emulator whose performance will be directly comparable.
